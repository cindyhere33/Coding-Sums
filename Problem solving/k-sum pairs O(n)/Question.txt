Given an array of integers and a number k, find the number of pairs in the array that sum to k.
eg: given [1,2,3,4,5] and a number k=6, there are 2 pairs (1,5) and (2,4)

Your program should also work for duplicates in the array.
eg: given [1,1,1] and a number k=2, there are 3 pairs (1,1) of index pair (0,1); (1,1) of index pair (0,2) and (1,1) of index pair(1,2)

Input:
First line consists of number of test cases T. The first line of each test case consists of N and K where N is the number of elements in the array
K is the sum. The second line of each test case contains N space separated numbers that compose the array

Output: 
The number of pairs for every testcase separated by a newline.
